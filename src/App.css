  /*
  The #root element is typically just a mount point.
  Global layout (like full height, page background) is handled by 'body' styles in index.css.
  Max-width and padding for content areas are best handled by specific layout components (e.g., <main>, page wrappers).
  Navbar and Footer components manage their own width and internal content constraints.
